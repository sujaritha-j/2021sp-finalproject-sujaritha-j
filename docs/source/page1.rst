Project Goal
------------

To propose and demonstrate an 'Enhanced product search', built on python, leveraging 'Word Embedding' and 'word2vec'.
By vectorizing the product description and the search text, we find the cosine similarity and the distance between them
to return the top matching products.
This would help in better understanding the consumer's search intent and retrieve products close to consumer's need.
